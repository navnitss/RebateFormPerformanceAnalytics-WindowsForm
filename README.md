# RebateFormPerformanceAnalytics-WindowsForm
A windows app to evaluate the performance of the data entry operator of the RebateForm app and generate stats of their entry job via the textfile generated by that app
Run the .exe file to open the app and then choose the output file.txt(CS6326Asg2.txt);

Program that analyzes the data file and writes the following things to a text file and to the screen:

a.	The number of records (should be 10.)

b.	The minimum, maximum, and average time to enter a single record.  Remember that records written by the program contain the start and stop time for that record.  Times should be in MM:SS format.

c.	The minimum, maximum, and average time between finishing entering a record and starting the next one.

d.	The total time from starting to enter the first record to finishing the last one.

e.	The number of times the user presses the “backspace” key while entering all 10 records.  To do this you will have to modify your original program to count the backspace key and put the count at the end of the existing record.  At the form level, there is a way to capture every keystroke, and you can look for character hex 08.
